# Cryptocurrency-Closing-Price-Prediction

## Challenge Description (From the organizers - Zindi)
  After the boom and bust of cryptocurrenciesâ€™ prices in recent years, cryptocurrencies have been increasingly regarded as an investment asset. Because of their highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Different existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate cryptocurrency price prediction. We are interested in applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures (qualitative and quantitative data) and dimensional features to achieve an optimization in price prediction.
